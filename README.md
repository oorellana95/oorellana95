## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Oscar Orellana, a **Software Development Engineer**, specialized in **Python Applications** but versed in Kotlin, Java, Javascript and React. I am graduated in **Computer Programming** and **International Business Economics**.

üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy programming and all related fields such as **Cloud Computing, Data and ML/AI**. I always try to go to **GDG & Meetup Events** related with the sector. Since I love coding, I **tutored classmates** from both of my degrees in programming subjects and I use to **mentor colleagues** about OOP and Clean Practices.

üßò Outside of tech, I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and learn new skills. Some of my hobbies include **learning new languages**, **running**, **writing**, **meditation**, **hiking** and **martial arts**.

üìö I also love reading books on **personal development**, **psichology/neuroscience** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain** by _Antonio Damasio_ in the genre of neuroscience and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.

 ‚úàÔ∏è I'm passionate about **traveling** too. I've visited over 30 countries (from Europe, Asia, Oceania and America) including:
* **Spain** üá™üá∏ (my birthplace, Barcelona)
* **Australia** üá¶üá∫ (where I lived for a year to learn English in Sydney in 2018)
* **Brazil** üáßüá∑ (where I spent 6 months on my bachelor's exchange in Rio de Janeiro in 2023)
* **Colombia** üá®üá¥ (where I'm living right now, in Medell√≠n)

I currently speak in Spanish, Catalan, English & Portuguese.
